    "text": "The purpose of Cabarrus Data Lab is to collect, analyze, and share data and data-driven insights for the benefit of the citizens of Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The intended impact is to increase people’s overall data literacy and provide awareness of social and economic factors that affect their lives.\nCabarrus Data Lab is a non-partisan project. Our only “ideology” is a commitment to the principles of open data, and a steadfast belief that knowledge is the best currency a citizen can have.\n\nOpen Data Principles\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, mel discere pertinax et. Ad pro mutat error similique. Mea vide justo ad, cum aperiam aliquid referrentur eu, pri et adhuc ceteros intellegat. An ius elit constituam, cum posse viderer ut, eum dicunt mandamus in.\nVim cu voluptatum ullamcorper. Ex zril bonorum interpretaris his, stet efficiantur eam eu. Ius quodsi propriae recusabo in, natum summo ad vel, graece quaestio gubergren cum eu. No ius epicurei dissentiunt, odio assum aperiri ad mei, quot placerat cu his. Diceret civibus vis et. Sea in iusto mollis, ad wisi perpetua hendrerit duo, cum ad consul causae.\n\n\nPeople\n\nPete Benbow\nI’m a Cabarrus County native, having been born, raised, and educated in Concord. I attended Beverly Hills Elementary, Concord Middle, and Concord High before completing my undergraduate studies just down the road at Davidson College. I grew up in the First Presbyterian Church of Concord and gave back to my community as a member of BSA Troop 3 and the Tarheel Keystone Club. I now have the privilege of teaching at Davidson as the James B. Duke Assistant Professor of the Practice in Data Science.\nMy wife, Megan, was also born, raised, and educated in Cabarrus County, having graduated from Northwest Cabarrus HS before attending UNC Chapel Hill. She grew up attending All Saints Episcopal Church. We bought our first home together in Concord in 2016. This county is part of our DNA.\nI believe in the adage “think global, act local.” As a data science educator, I have access to tools and skills that I know can benefit the people of Cabarrus County, and that’s what this project aims to do."
